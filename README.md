# Faster_RCNN_SSIM

This project uses Faster RCNN with a ResNet-50 FPN backbone, enhanced with SSIM loss, to detect camouflaged objects in military scenarios. 

The integration of SSIM loss improves the modelâ€™s sensitivity to subtle structural differences, making it more effective in identifying concealed targets in complex environments where standard object detectors often fail due to low visual contrast.
